Tracking changes between versions of package EpiBayes

--------------------------------
Version 0.1.2: 6/23/2015
--------------------------------

	# Minor updates including creation of utils_ functions:
		# utils_newalphbet() for location shift of beta distribution
		# utils_mumhproposaldist() and utils_mumhtargetdist() for the proposal and target distributions for mu in the MH steps in the hybrid Gibbs sampler executed by the EpiBayes_ns() and EpiBayes_s() functions

--------------------------------
Version 0.1.1: 6/16/2015
--------------------------------
	
	# MAJOR UPDATE: Main functions EpiBayes_ns() and EpiBayes_s() now calculate latent indicator variables for the prevalences at the various sampling levels while taking the design prevalence at those respective levels into account
	# Updated vignettes
	# Updated calculations of p2.tilde, p4.tilde, and p6.tilde in EpiBayes_ns() (now calculates with burnin) and EpiBayes_s() (now calculates correctly)
	# Fixed issue with summary.eb() where it would return an error if n.output > reps. Now detects the issue and returns 10 reps' summary statistics instead
	# summary.eb() now prints output by default
	# EpiBayes_ns() and EpiBayes_s() now check for size of y matrix to be correct

--------------------------------
Version 0.1.0: 6/2/2015
