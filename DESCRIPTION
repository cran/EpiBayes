        Applications

Description: Hierarchical Bayesian models for use in disease 
		freedom and disease prevalence studies, designed 
		with epidemiological applications in mind. The models 
		themselves are in the spirit of those presented in Branscum 
		et al. (2006) (see package documentation for full 
		reference). The helper functions and methods were designed 
		to make implementation and processing of the complex model 
		output relatively simple in application.
