\usage{
ebsamplesize(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object.}
}
\description{
This function is used as a generic for the \code{ebsamplesize} object class. This class
    is used to store output from the sample size search function
    \code{\link{EpiBayesSampleSize}}.
}
\details{
The \code{\link{EpiBayes_s}} and \code{\link{EpiBayes_ns}} functions return objects of the
    class \code{eb}, for which this is the generic. This class of objects is used to
    store the output of the EpiBayes models and to reference the \code{print},
    \code{summary}, and \code{plot} methods for these output objects.
}
\seealso{
Other classes' generics used within this package include \code{\link{eb}} for output
    objects of \code{\link{EpiBayes_ns}} and \code{\link{EpiBayes_s}},
    \code{\link{ebhistorical}} for output objects of the \code{\link{EpiBayesHistorical}}
    function and \code{\link{ebsamplesize}} for output objects of the
    \code{\link{EpiBayesSampleSize}} function.
