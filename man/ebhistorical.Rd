This function is used as a generic for the \code{ebhistorical} object class. This class is
    used to store output from the historical function \code{\link{EpiBayesHistorical}}.
}

The \code{\link{EpiBayes_s}} and \code{\link{EpiBayes_ns}} functions return objects of the
    class \code{eb}, for which this is the generic. This class of objects is used to
    store the output of the EpiBayes models and to reference the \code{print},
    \code{summary}, and \code{plot} methods for these output objects.
